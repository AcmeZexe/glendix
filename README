GNU/Linux is a popular free operating system in use today. GNU/Linux
strives to be strictly compliant with POSIX standards, and is thus
tied down with several requirements and thereby ceases to be innovative
as far as operating system design is concerned.

Plan 9 from Bell Labs, on the other hand, was designed to be a
from-scratch successor to UNIX. The Plan 9 operating system offers
several new features that are both useful and efﬁcient in today’s era
of personal computing: synthetic ﬁle systems, the “everything is a ﬁle”
concept, per-process namespaces and a fresh look at graphics and text
editors are just a few. 

The Plan 9 kernel, however, is relatively new and thus supports only
a bare minimum of hardware. That is one of the reasons of its
unpopularity. The Linux kernel on the other hand has had years of
development behind it, and enjoys the support of several hardware
components and developers alike. This project aims to combine the
Plan 9 user-space with the Linux kernel, to offer today’s developer an
exciting environment combining the best features of both the worlds.
